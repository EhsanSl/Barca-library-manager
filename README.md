# Barca-library-manager
 An online library management system.

This website was originally designed to meet assignment requirements. For simplicity, users can create an account as either an admin or a regular user. After logging in, any type of user can borrow books. The return deadline is determined by their status, such as whether they are a teacher or a student.

Users can borrow new books as long as their account is not penalized by fines for late returns. If they have outstanding fines, they must pay them before borrowing new books.

Admins have two panels: one for managing users and another for managing books. Admins can also borrow books for themselves.
